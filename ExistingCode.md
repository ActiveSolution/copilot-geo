# Work with existing code
## Rules

- When you don't know what to do or need help with something that is wrong with the code. Use Copilot Chat, It's not allowed to use resources on the internet.
- Use what you know but you can also pretend that you don't know and challenge what Copilot can do.

## Tips

- I you don't like what you get from Copilot you can change the promt to be more specific and regenerate.
- Think in "steps" get copilot to help out one step at a time.
- If you don't know what to do next or at all, start with asking in the Chat window.
- Be as specific as you can in the chat window, it will help Copilot to help you.

## Target (read this before you start)
Clone the dotnet samples project from [`https://github.com/dotnet/samples.git`](https://github.com/dotnet/samples.git). 

Choose a project or a solution that doesn't have tests and add test to it. I breifly browesed the repo and found a solution at `/orleans/Blazor/BlazorServer/BlazorServer.sln` that you can use. Or use any other project that you find in the repo. Ask CoPilot to add tests for the project.

Find a project that uses a language or a technique you havn't used before. Use the `/explain`-command and let CoPilot explain some part of the code. If you have the `Github Copilot Labs` you can try to use the `Language Translation` to translate the code to a language you are more comfortable with.

You can also use this example project with code in Rust. [`https://github.com/ProgrammingRust/examples.git`](https://github.com/ProgrammingRust/examples.git) if you havn't worked with Rust before.

## Detailed Instructions & Excepted Result 
- The main point here is that you try to use CoPilot to do things you usually do manually.
- There is really no right or wrong, just try to push CoPilot and see what it can do to help you in your daily work
- If you add tests - make sure you can run the tests and that the tests are green.
